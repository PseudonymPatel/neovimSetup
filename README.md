# neovimSetup
Sets up my neovim setup with packages and vimrc

# instructions for me because i forget every time i do this
- Install neovim from whatever main pkg manager  
- Make sure python3 is installed  
- Make sure pip3 works
- Run the script? or just use it as reference?
- bingo?

- for pythong linting also install flake8 (not in script) and make sure callable from cmd line :)
